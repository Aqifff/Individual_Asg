    <h3><span>Lyrics</span></h3>
<br>
I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
<br>
I'm sayin', "See you again, " so many times, it's becoming my tagline
    <br>
But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
        <br>
Than try to catch this flight
            <br>
So many things I'd rather say
                <br>
But for now, it's goodbye
            <br>
You say I'm always leavin'
        <br>
You, when you're sleepin' alone
    <br>
But the, the car's outside
<br>
But I don't wanna go tonight
<br>
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
    <br>
Unless you pack your bags
        <br>
You're comin' with me
            <br>
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
                <br>
And never being where you are
            <br>
Close the windows, lock the doors
    <br>
Don't wanna leave you anymore
<br>
Oh-oh, ah
<br>
I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
    <br>
It's an unfamiliar feelin' but I know it so well
        <br>
Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
            <br>
Than this mobile in my hand
                <br>
But I guess it'll do, 'cause for you
                    <br>
I would run up my phone bill
                <br>
You say I'm always leavin'
            <br>
You, when you need me the most
        <br>
But the, the car's outside
    <br>
But I don't wanna go tonight
<br>
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
<br>
Unless you pack your bags
    <br>
You're comin' with me
            <br>
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
                    <br>
And never being where you are
            <br>
Close the windows, lock the doors
    <br>
Don't wanna leave you anymore
<br>
Ooh-ooh, ah
<br>
Ooh-ooh, ah
    <br>
Ooh-ooh, ah
            <br>
Don't wanna leave you anymore
                    <br>
Oh, darling, all of the city lights
                        <br>
Never shine as bright as your eyes
                    <br>
I would trade them all for a minute more
            <br>
But the car's outside
        <br>
And he's called me twice
<br>
But he's gonna have to wait tonight
    <br>
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
        <br>
Unless you pack your bags
            <br>
You're comin' with me
                <br>
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
                    <br>
And never being where you are
                    <br>
Close the windows, lock the doors
                <br>
Don't wanna leave you anymore
            <br>
Ooh-ooh, ah
        <br>
Ooh-ooh, ah
    <br>
Ooh-ooh, ah
<br>
No, I don't wanna leave you anymore
<br>
I don't wanna leave you
    <br>
(Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
        <br>
(Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
        <br>
Don't wanna leave you anymore

<h3><span>Lyrics</span></h3>
    <br>
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
<br>
You made me feel as though I was enough
<br>
We danced the night away, we drank too much
<br>
I held your hair back when
<br>
You were throwing up
<br>
Then you smiled over your shoulder
<br>
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
<br>
I pulled you closer to my chest
<br>
And you asked me to stay over
<br>
I said, "I already told ya
<br>
I think that you should get some rest"
<br>
I knew I loved you then
<br>
But you'd never know
<br>
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
<br>
I know I needed you
<br>
But I never showed
<br>
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
<br>
Just say you won't let go
<br>
Just say you won't let go
<br>
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
<br>
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
<br>
And I'll take the kids to school
<br>
Wave them goodbye
<br>
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
<br>
When you looked over your shoulder
<br>
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
<br>
I wanna dance with you right now
<br>
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
<br>
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
<br>
You make me feel this way somehow
<br>
I'm so in love with you
<br>
And I hope you know
<br>
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
<br>
We've come so far, my dear
<br>
Look how we've grown
<br>
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
<br>
Just say you won't let go
<br>
Just say you won't let go
<br>
I wanna live with you
<br>
Even when we're ghosts
<br>
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most
<br>
I'm gonna love you 'til
<br>
My lungs give out
<br>
I promise 'til death we part like in our vows
<br>
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
<br>
That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old
<br>
Just say you won't let go
<br>
Just say you won't let go
<br>
Just say you won't let go
<br>
Oh, just say you won't let go
<br>
    <br>

<h3><span>Lyrics</span></h3>
    <br>

When we're out in a crowd laughing loud
<br>
And nobody knows why
<br>
When we're lost at a club, getting drunk
<br>
And you give me that smile
<br>
Going home in the back of a car
<br>
And your hand touches mine
<br>
When we're done making love
<br>
And you look up and give me those eyes
<br>
'Cause all of the small things that you do
<br>
Are what remind me why I fell for you
<br>
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
<br>
I close my eyes and all I see is you
<br>
And the small things you do
<br>
When you call me at night while you're out
<br>
Getting high with your friends (high with your friends)
<br>
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said
<br>
(You've ever said)
<br>
'Cause all of the small things that you do
<br>
Are what remind me why I fell for you
<br>
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
<br>
I close my eyes and all I see is you
<br>
And the small things you do
<br>
When we're done making love
<br>
And you look up and give me those eyes
<br>
'Cause all of the small things that you do
<br>
Are what remind me why I fell for you
<br>
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
<br>
I close my eyes and all I see is you
<br>
And the small things you do
<br>
All the small things you do
